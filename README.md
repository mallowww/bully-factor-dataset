# Title: Predicting Bullies in Schools
The project aims to predict bullies in schools by considering various factors such as physical and cyberbullying, feelings of loneliness, and missing school without permission. The model can identify students who are at risk of becoming bullies and take preventative measures to address the issue. Our study highlights the importance of addressing bullying in schools to create a safe and healthy learning environment for all students.
